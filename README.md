### Changelog of current stable build 1.0.0

#### General
* First release of this package - it contains all utility, recode and statistical test functions from the [sjPlot package](https://github.com/sjPlot/devel/).

#### New functions
* `rec` to recode variables.
* `cv` to compute coefficient of variance.
* `rmse` to compute root-mean-square error.

#### Changes to former sjPlot functions
* Improved internal management of imported data via `haven` and `foreign` packages, so users don't need to care of structure and classed of data read with either haven, foreign or sjPlot's read-functions.
