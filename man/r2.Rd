\title{Compute R-squared of (generalized) linear (mixed) models}
\usage{
r2(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted model of class \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{lmerMod}/\code{lme}
or \code{glmerMod}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
          \item For linear models, the r-squared and adjusted r-squared values.
          \item For linear mixed models, the r-squared and Omega-squared values.
          \item For \code{glm} objects, Cox & Snell's and Nagelkerke's pseudo r-squared values.
          \item For \code{glmerMod} objects, Tjur's coefficient of determination.

\description{
Compute R-squared values of linear (mixed) models, or
               pseudo-R-squared values for generalized linear (mixed) models.
}
\note{
For linear models, the r-squared and adjusted r-squared value is returned,
        as provided by the \code{summary}-function.
        \cr \cr
        For linear mixed models, an r-squared approximation by computing the
        correlation between the fitted and observed values, as suggested by
        Byrnes (2008), is returned as well as the Omega-squared value as
        suggested by Xu (2003).
        \cr \cr
        For generalized linear models, Cox & Snell's and Nagelkerke's
        pseudo r-squared values are returned.
        \cr \cr
        For generalized linear mixed models, the coefficient of determination
        as suggested by Tjur (2009) (see also \code{\link{cod}}).
