Version 1.7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
* Package is now depending on R >= 3.2, because some macros for RD-files did not work on older R-releases.

New functions:
* `merge_df` to fully join labelled data frame and preserve value and variable labels.
* `wtd_sd` to compute weighted standard deviations.
* `wtd_se` to compute weighted standard errors.
* `get_note` and `set_note` to annotate vectors.
* `re_var` to print random effect variances of `merMod`-objects. This function is just a convenient wrapper for `print.icc.lme4` with `comp`-argument.
* `print.labelled` generic method for printing labelled class vectors. Unlike 'haven's print-method, this method also prints variable labels and, if available, vector annotations and missing value attributes.
* S3-method `model.frame.gls`.

Changes to functions:
* `icc` now also returns variance parameters of random effects as attributes.
* `print.icc.lme4` gets a `comp`-argument to also print variance parameters (see `?icc` for details).
* `r2` also computes pseudo-R2 based on random effect variances.
* S3-method `mean.labelled` only prints a message instead of warning, when `x` has labelled missing values.


Version 1.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* `rec_pattern` to generate recode patterns for the `rec` function.
* `drop_labels` to drop labels from values with zero-counts.
* `str_contains` to check whether a string contains another string pattern.
* `r2` to compute R-squared values for linear (mixed) models.
* `lbl_df` to create a labelled data frame, and related S3-generic print method for `lbl_df` objects.

Changes to functions:
* `cv` now accepts multiple arguments.
* `icc` now accepts multiple arguments.
* `weight` now also weights character vectors.
* `overdisp` now wraps `AER::dispersiontest` to also support simple glm's.
* Removed deprecated functions.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug in `ref_lvl`, where value labels were not correctly re-ordered for factors that had a `0` as level.
* Fixed bug in `rec`, where value labels were not automatically re-ordered when `x` was a numeric factor.


Version 1.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* `to_long` to gather (transform from wide to long format) multiple column groups at once.
* S3-method `model.matrix` for `nlme::gls` class.

Changes to functions:
* `std_beta` now supports `nlme::gls` models.

Bug fixes:
* `word_wrap` now removes `NA` values from `labels` before wrapping strings.
* `set_na` now drops unused factor levels that have been replaced with `NA` values.


Version 1.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* `to_dummy` to split vectors with more than two categories into 0/1-coded dummy variables.
* `overdisp` (based on [DRAFT r-sig-mixed-models FAQ](http://glmm.wikidot.com/faq)) to compute approximate overdispersion parameters for `glmer` models.

Changes to functions:
* `to_value` can now also deal with character vectors.
* `is_empty` now also checks non-character vectors for zero-length.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed bug with `std_beta`, which computed wrong standardized beta coefficients for factor variables in `lm`.


Version 1.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General:
* `set_labels` and `add_labels` now make consistent use of values as `labels` attributes and value labels as `names` attribute of `labels` attribute (being in line with `labelled` class now).
* `remove_labels` was renamed into `remove_all_labels`.
* Removed deprecated functions and arguments.

New functions:
* `split_var` to split a vector into equal sized groups.
* `ref_lvl` to change the reference level of (numeric) factors.
* `remove_labels` to remove selected label attributes from a vector.

Changes to functions:
* `to_factor` gets a `ref.lvl` argument, to automatically change the reference level when converting numeric vectors into factors.
* `replace_na` gets a `na.label` argument to optionally set a value label for the NA value.
* `get_label` gets a `def.value` argument, which will be returned when vectors have no label attribute.


Version 1.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New functions:
* `converge_ok` to test convergence for merMod-objects (mixed effects models).

Changes to functions:
* `weight` gets a `digits` argument.

Bug fixes:

* Renamed argument `autoAttachVarLabels` of `read_spss` into `attach.var.labels`.
